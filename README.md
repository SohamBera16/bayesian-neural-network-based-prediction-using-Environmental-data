Using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) in regression as well as classification tasks based on the below mentioned oceanographic dataset.

The dataset used for performing the experimentations is the CalCOFI: Over 60 years of oceanographic data from Kaggle.

## Context/Business understanding: 
The CalCOFI data set represents the longest (1949-present) and most complete (more than 50,000 sampling stations) time series of oceanographic and larval fish data in the world.
It includes abundance data on the larvae of over 250 species of fish; larval length frequency data and egg abundance data on key commercial species; and oceanographic and plankton data. The physical, chemical, and biological data collected at regular time and space intervals quickly became valuable for documenting climatic cycles in the California Current and a range of biological responses to them. CalCOFI research drew world attention to the biological response to the dramatic Pacific-warming event in 1957-58 and introduced the term “El Niño” into the scientific literature.
